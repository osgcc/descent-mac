 * Revision 1.30  1994/11/05  14:05:53  john
 * Fixed fade transitions between all screens by making gr_palette_fade_in and out keep
 * track of whether the palette is faded in or not.  Then, wherever the code needs to fade out,
 * it just calls gr_palette_fade_out and it will fade out if it isn't already.  The same with fade_in.
