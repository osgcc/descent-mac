 * Initial revision
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1995/02/27  11:33:06  john
 * New version 2.0, which has no anonymous unions, builds with
 * Watcom 10.0, and doesn't require parsing BITMAPS.TBL.

 * 
 * Revision 1.27  1994/08/01  13:29:42  matt
 * Made fvi() check holes in transparent walls, and changed fvi() calling
 * parms to take all input data in query structure.
 * 
 * Revision 1.26  1994/07/28  12:35:22  matt
 * Added prototype
 * 
 * Revision 1.25  1994/07/13  21:48:05  matt
 * FVI() and physics now keep lists of segments passed through which the
