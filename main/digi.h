 *
 * Revision 1.5  1995/09/13  08:44:34  allender
 * removed commented out defines and added digi_load_sounds prototype
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1995/08/18  10:25:57  allender
 * added back digi_kill_sound object calls as real function
 * calls
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1995/07/17  08:49:32  allender
 * changed some prototypes
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1995/05/26  06:52:49  allender

 * Changed sound stuff to allow low memory usage.
 * Also, changed so that Sounds isn't an array of digi_sounds, it
 * is a ubyte pointing into GameSounds, this way the digi.c code that
 * locks sounds won't accidentally unlock a sound that is already playing, but
 * since it's Sounds[soundno] is different, it would erroneously be unlocked.
