 *
 * Revision 1.1  1995/05/16  15:32:00  allender
 * Initial revision
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1995/02/27  11:32:41  john
 * New version 2.0, which has no anonymous unions, builds with
 * Watcom 10.0, and doesn't require parsing BITMAPS.TBL.
 * 
 * Revision 1.8  1994/09/25  23:40:52  matt
 * Changed the object load & save code to read/write the structure fields one
 * at a time (rather than the whole structure at once).  This mean that the
 * object structure can be changed without breaking the load/save functions.
 * As a result of this change, the local_object data can be and has been 
 * incorporated into the object array.  Also, timeleft is now a property 
 * of all objects, and the object structure has been otherwise cleaned up.
 * 
 * Revision 1.7  1994/09/25  15:45:26  matt
 * Added OBJ_LIGHT, a type of object that casts light
 * Added generalized lifeleft, and moved it to local_object
 * 
 * Revision 1.6  1994/09/09  20:05:57  mike
 * Add vclips for weapons.
 * 
 * Revision 1.5  1994/06/14  21:14:35  matt
 * Made rod objects draw lighted or not depending on a parameter, so the
 * materialization effect no longer darkens.
 * 
 * Revision 1.4  1994/06/08  18:16:24  john
 * Bunch of new stuff that basically takes constants out of the code
 * and puts them into bitmaps.tbl.
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  1994/06/03  10:47:17  matt
 * Made vclips (used by explosions) which can be either rods or blobs, as
 * specified in BITMAPS.TBL.  (This is for the materialization center effect).
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  1994/05/11  09:25:25  john
 * Abandoned new vclip system for now because each wallclip, vclip,
 * etc, is different and it would be a huge pain to change all of them.
 * 
 * Revision 1.1  1994/05/10  15:21:12  john
