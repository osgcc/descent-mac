 * $Log: aistruct.h $
 * Revision 1.2  1995/10/10  11:49:04  allender
 * PC ai code
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1995/05/16  15:54:08  allender
 * Initial revision
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1995/02/27  11:30:19  john
 * New version 2.0, which has no anonymous unions, builds with
 * Watcom 10.0, and doesn't require parsing BITMAPS.TBL.
 * 
 * Revision 1.34  1995/01/25  13:50:46  mike
 * Robots make angry sounds.
 * 
 * Revision 1.33  1994/12/29  12:44:56  rob
 * Added new coop robot flag.
 * 
 * Revision 1.32  1994/12/20  20:41:54  rob
 * Added new ai flag for multiplayer robots.
 * 
 * Revision 1.31  1994/12/19  16:37:39  rob
 * Added a new flag for remote controlled objects.
 * 
 * Revision 1.30  1994/12/07  00:36:07  mike
 * fix phys_apply_rot for robots -- ai was bashing effect in next frame.
 * 
 * Revision 1.29  1994/12/02  22:06:28  mike
 * add fields to allow robots to make awareness sounds every so often, not every damn blasted frame
 * 
 * Revision 1.28  1994/11/04  17:18:35  yuan
 * Increased MAX_SEG_POINTS to 2500.
 * 
 * Revision 1.27  1994/10/17  21:19:22  mike

 * 
 * Revision 1.26  1994/10/12  21:28:38  mike
 * Add new ai mode: AIM_OPEN_DOOR.
 * Add GOALSIDE to aip.
 * 
 * Revision 1.25  1994/09/25  23:41:08  matt
 * Changed the object load & save code to read/write the structure fields one
 * at a time (rather than the whole structure at once).  This mean that the
 * object structure can be changed without breaking the load/save functions.
 * As a result of this change, the local_object data can be and has been 
 * incorporated into the object array.  Also, timeleft is now a property 
 * of all objects, and the object structure has been otherwise cleaned up.
 * 
 * Revision 1.24  1994/09/21  12:28:11  mike
 * Change AI behavior for when player cloaked
 *

 * 
 * Revision 1.21  1994/09/15  16:31:38  mike
 * Define GREEN_GUY
 * Add previous_visibility to ai_local struct.
 * 
 * Revision 1.20  1994/09/12  19:12:45  mike

 * 
 * Revision 1.19  1994/08/25  21:53:31  mike
